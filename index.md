Ben Scott's Website!
====================

This is my website. It's not ready yet, but you can look at a spinning monitor lizard (pictured above) until it is.

I have stolen this background from D. Scott Brown's [Rubicon X](http://www.marathonrubicon.com) website, as the last one was tacky and I haven't finished the new one yet. The thievery and low cunning will be over by the weekend, no later.
