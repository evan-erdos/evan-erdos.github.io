<u>EXTERIOR, POLICE STATION - EVENING<u>

A cold wind blows, police cars sporadically come and go.

Outside are a man and a teenage boy. The <u>FATHER</u> is well dressed, his hair combed over. His son's <u>FRIEND</u> has no such style, and is trembling slightly. His son's <u>FRIEND</u> is smoking cigarettes and coughing, which suggests it's a recent habit.

> The <u>FATHER</u> presents a clear contempt for his son's <u>FRIEND</u>: he doesn't trust his son's judgment when it comes to choosing friends. His <u>SON</u> has, in the past, made such mistakes.

The <u>FATHER</u> rushes in, frantically looking for his son.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Where's my son! Where is he? I demand--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	I know where your son is.

The <u>FATHER</u> turns and looks at the <u>FRIEND</u>.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	You know where my son is? You know my son?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Yes.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	You will tell me what he did.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	No, I won't.

> unwilling to divulge anything, the <u>FRIEND</u> doesn't want the <u>SON</u> in any more of a predicament than he's already in.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	You will *tell* me what he did.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	He didn't do anything.

> This is a statement of opinion, disguised as matter-of-fact. He does, however, believe it.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	That can't be the whole truth. They don't just... arrest people over nothing.

The wind shifts.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	[coughing] Can you exhale that filth some other direction?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	No.

> the <u>FATHER</u> would ordinarily storm off angrily, however, he suspects that his <u>SON</u>'s <u>FRIEND</u> knows something, and his curiosity stays his hand.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Useless. just--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	--Your son did nothing wrong.


The <u>FATHER</u> sighs, and calms down slightly.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Were the two of you...?

> the <u>FATHER</u> doesn't even know who his <u>SON</u>'s friends are

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Yes... he was... a good friend.

The two of them stand still for a moment.

> The <u>FATHER</u> wants resolution, he wants to know if his <u>SON</u> actually did something wrong. He needs to believe that he still knows who his <u>SON</u> is. Too little too late, but he's trying to make up for lost time by learning all he can after the fact.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	He told me some of the things you said to him.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Oh did he, now? Would you care to enlighten me?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Yeah, yeah I will. He said you told him you'd take him back to fucking jail if you found drugs on him.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Oh that's absurd. That's--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	You can't say shit like that and expect him to act like a fucking human being, can you? That something to say when you want someone to behave like a scared animal!

> While this kid may not be all-so-charismatic, he's an expert at picking nerves, and the <u>FATHER</u> has a lot of nerves to pick, now that his son is in jail.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	ENOUGH! Who are you to *question* my parenting? You don't have a child, you don't know the **first** thing about these matters! I will discipline my child as I see fit, and I'll be-

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Do whatever the fuck you want! I don't give a *shit* how you parent, or how firm you think you need to be with him, or any of this, I'm just telling you how it is!

		<u>FATHER</u>
	I don't need to stand here and listen to this profan--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	If you keep this shit up, you're going to push him away so far that he never comes back.

> This takes the steam out of the <u>FATHER</u>'s rage & contempt
> for his <u>FRIEND</u>, as it presents the <u>FATHER</u> with
> a very plausible prognosis of what might happen / may already
> be happening to his relationship with his son.

The <u>FATHER</u> pauses for a moment, so his <u>FRIEND</u> continues on.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Do you have any idea what you're doing to him? Do you know the sorts of fucked up things he tells me?

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Enough of this vulgarity. You will speak to me as you would your own father.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	*(sighs sarcastically)* I am.

> The <u>FATHER</u> goes through a microcosm of culture-shock, as it didn't occur to him that his <u>FRIEND</u>'s vulgar speech wasn't aimed at him, or intended to irritate him.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	You'll speak to me with a bit more **respect** from now on.

> This is the <u>FATHER</u>'s way of accepting this friend of his son's, i.e., taking the good with the bad. The <u>FATHER</u> is now willing to put aside his contempt for this slimy kid, if only to get information out of him.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	He told me he wanted to get a cyanide tooth, in the case that you send him back to prison like you *said* you would.

> The father now knows that his son's friend is telling the truth, but he keeps a serious, condescending visage.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	My son would... **never** say something like that. This is preposterous, and I've had just about enough of you telling me lies about *my* own son, he--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Did you say you'd send him back if you ever found drugs on him?

		<u>FATHER</u>
	You have *NO* right to question-

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Did you say something like that?

The father concedes by saying nothing, and moving on to another topic.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	What happened to my son? What has happened to my son? You were there, you were... you were... around, right?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Not that day.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Well, you must have heard rumors, right? You must have heard something.

> the father is having quite a time of disguising his interest.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Doesn't he talk to you? Don't you know already?

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Well, I--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Fascinating.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	I'm... it's not my fault he doesn't call anymore.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Isn't it?

> father takes on a very dismissive tone.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	He was *always* like this, he never listened or talked to me if I didn't ask. I *always* asked him about his day, and he stopped answering a long time ago.

> "How could he treat us so thought-less-ly?"
> "How could he *do* this to *meee*"

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Yeah, that happens. Isn't that a well-known phenomenon? Isn't that *what* happens?

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Yes, of course--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	So, what is it then?

		<u>FATHER</u>
	He just... he could have called me. I could have...

The father becomes visibly broken up.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Maybe.

> The <u>FRIEND</u> wants to leverage this emotion against
> the <u>FATHER</u>, but decides to leave this one alone, as he
> noticed the way the <u>FATHER</u> was bartering for his son in
> some hypothetical sense.

The two shuffle around in the cold for a moment.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	You must tell me what happened. I must know what happened to my son.

> Given that the <u>SON</u> was his friend's only introduction to
> the <u>FATHER</u>, the <u>FATHER</u>'s words here are something of
> a surprise to the <u>FRIEND</u>. The <u>FATHER</u> here defies
> the <u>FRIEND</u>'s initial opinion, as it is now clear to
> him that the <u>FATHER</u> cares quite deeply about his <u>SON</u>.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Ok, so... he got... confused, and...

> the friend here doesn't want to say anything to make the
> <u>SON</u>'s life worse, which the truth certainly would do.
> he also doesn't want to be culpable for this, especially
> given his own agency in the <u>SON</u>'s downfall.

		<u>FATHER</u>
	Out with it, come on.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	He got a hold of some drugs, and just kinda lost it.

> lies: he gave the drugs to the <u>SON</u> himself.

The <u>FATHER</u> autonomously coughs out loud, enraged.

> The <u>FATHER</u> has an earnest problem with controlling his
> anger after hearing this.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
	What... sorts of drugs?

> Undisguised interest flashes across the <u>FATHER</u>'s face.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Look, you gotta promise me you aren't going to beat him or something because of what I tell you. He's been through so much shit, man, the police dragged him to the ground and shit...

 		<u>FATHER</u>
	Answer the question.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Promise me.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
	I don't *beat* my children!

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Yeah, oh, good on you, that's fucking great, but it's not good enough. You've done a number on him already, *without* laying a hand on him.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
	No, no, no no no. He has done *all* of this to himself, I didn't--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Yeah, sure, fine, not your fault, whatever, I'll even pretend that it's not related, just for you, but you have to promise me you're not going to make his life a living hell with what I tell you.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
	I'll react however I see fit. What do you want from me? You want me to--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	I want you to not rip him apart. What do you think? Do you think, "ah, shit, that stupid kid, he needs to know that he was wrong, I should"--

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	I can't just pat him on the back if he has broken the *law*! It's my **job** to--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	It's your *job* to scare the shit out of your own son?

The father looks uncomfortable.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	Look where we are! I'm outside a Police Office! People who haven't done anything wrong don't come here!

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Look, the only thing your son needs right now is to feel safe. He's been through more shit today than anyone I've ever seen, but it's getting to him, I can tell.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	You think you know *my* son better than I do?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Yes. I do. I can tell the difference between his usual level of crazy and the real deal.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	Nonsense. I raised that boy.

> The <u>FATHER</u> here shows clear signs of being unable to
> differentiate such, which points to a pattern of behaviour.
> He frequently misinterprets his <u>SON</u>'s actions as insane
> or as evidence of some malaise to be cured by doctors.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Deny whatever you want.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	I certainly will! Especially if I find out he's turned into some sort of criminal!

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	He was my friend.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	Has he killed someone? Was he doing drugs? What did my son do?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Oh, and now you're interested in what happens to him?

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	He's my son! of course I--

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	He was my friend.

The wind stops blowing, and the <u>FRIEND</u> is out of cigarettes.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Look, your son didn't do anything... He was released an hour ago.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	What! And you didn't tell me?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	I wanted to make sure you didn't screw him up. He's a good kid.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	You think I don't know that?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	I wanted to make sure, for his sake.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	So that's why you're still out here in the cold.

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	No. I'm not going to jail tonight, but I feel guilty.

 		<u>FATHER</u>
 	Guilty about what?

		<u>FRIEND</u>
	Nothing, goddamn it. Just, forgive him, when you see him. Forgive him right there and then. He might have been the one in the jail cell, but it isn't all his fault. I gotta go, I'm out of cigarettes.

The <u>FATHER</u> goes to find his son, and his son's <u>FRIEND</u> wanders off, down a dark street.
