EXTERIOR, POLICE STATION - EVENING

A cold wind blows, police cars sporadically come and go.

Outside are a man and a teenage boy. The FATHER is well dressed, his hair combed over. His son's FRIEND has no such style, and is trembling slightly. His son's FRIEND is smoking cigarettes and coughing, which suggests it's a recent habit.


The FATHER rushes in, frantically looking for his son.

		FATHER
	Where's my son! Where is he? I demand--

		FRIEND
	I know where your son is.

The FATHER turns and looks at the FRIEND.

		FATHER
	You know where my son is? You know my son?

		FRIEND
	Yes.

		FATHER
	You will tell me what he did.

		FRIEND
	No, I won't.


		FATHER
	You will *tell* me what he did.

		FRIEND
	He didn't do anything.


		FATHER
	That can't be the whole truth. They don't just... arrest people over nothing.

The wind shifts.

		FATHER
	[coughing] Can you exhale that filth some other direction?

		FRIEND
	No.


		FATHER
	Useless. just--

		FRIEND
	--Your son did nothing wrong.


The FATHER sighs, and calms down slightly.

		FATHER
	Were the two of you...?


		FRIEND
	Yes... he was... a good friend.

The two of them stand still for a moment.


		FRIEND
	He told me some of the things you said to him.

		FATHER
	Oh did he, now? Would you care to enlighten me?

		FRIEND
	Yeah, yeah I will. He said you told him you'd take him back to fucking jail if you found drugs on him.

		FATHER
	Oh that's absurd. That's--

		FRIEND
	You can't say shit like that and expect him to act like a fucking human being, can you? That something to say when you want someone to behave like a scared animal!


		FATHER
	ENOUGH! Who are you to *question* my parenting? You don't have a child, you don't know the **first** thing about these matters! I will discipline my child as I see fit, and I'll be-

		FRIEND
	Do whatever the fuck you want! I don't give a *shit* how you parent, or how firm you think you need to be with him, or any of this, I'm just telling you how it is!

		FATHER
	I don't need to stand here and listen to this profan--

		FRIEND
	If you keep this shit up, you're going to push him away so far that he never comes back.


The FATHER pauses for a moment, so his FRIEND continues on.

		FRIEND
	Do you have any idea what you're doing to him? Do you know the sorts of fucked up things he tells me?

		FATHER
	Enough of this vulgarity. You will speak to me as you would your own father.

		FRIEND
	*(sighs sarcastically)* I am.


		FATHER
	You'll speak to me with a bit more **respect** from now on.


		FRIEND
	He told me he wanted to get a cyanide tooth, in the case that you send him back to prison like you *said* you would.


		FATHER
	My son would... **never** say something like that. This is preposterous, and I've had just about enough of you telling me lies about *my* own son, he--

		FRIEND
	Did you say you'd send him back if you ever found drugs on him?

		FATHER
	You have *NO* right to question-

		FRIEND
	Did you say something like that?

The father concedes by saying nothing, and moving on to another topic.

		FATHER
	What happened to my son? What has happened to my son? You were there, you were... you were... around, right?

		FRIEND
	Not that day.

		FATHER
	Well, you must have heard rumors, right? You must have heard something.


		FRIEND
	Doesn't he talk to you? Don't you know already?

		FATHER
	Well, I--

		FRIEND
	Fascinating.

		FATHER
	I'm... it's not my fault he doesn't call anymore.

		FRIEND
	Isn't it?


		FATHER
	He was *always* like this, he never listened or talked to me if I didn't ask. I *always* asked him about his day, and he stopped answering a long time ago.


		FRIEND
	Yeah, that happens. Isn't that a well-known phenomenon? Isn't that *what* happens?

		FATHER
	Yes, of course--

		FRIEND
	So, what is it then?

		FATHER
	He just... he could have called me. I could have...

The father becomes visibly broken up.

		FRIEND
	Maybe.


The two shuffle around in the cold for a moment.

		FATHER
	You must tell me what happened. I must know what happened to my son.


		FRIEND
	Ok, so... he got... confused, and...


		FATHER
	Out with it, come on.

		FRIEND
	He got a hold of some drugs, and just kinda lost it.


The FATHER autonomously coughs out loud, enraged.


 		FATHER
	What... sorts of drugs?


		FRIEND
	Look, you gotta promise me you aren't going to beat him or something because of what I tell you. He's been through so much shit, man, the police dragged him to the ground and shit...

 		FATHER
	Answer the question.

		FRIEND
	Promise me.

 		FATHER
	I don't *beat* my children!

		FRIEND
	Yeah, oh, good on you, that's fucking great, but it's not good enough. You've done a number on him already, *without* laying a hand on him.

 		FATHER
	No, no, no no no. He has done *all* of this to himself, I didn't--

		FRIEND
	Yeah, sure, fine, not your fault, whatever, I'll even pretend that it's not related, just for you, but you have to promise me you're not going to make his life a living hell with what I tell you.

 		FATHER
	I'll react however I see fit. What do you want from me? You want me to--

		FRIEND
	I want you to not rip him apart. What do you think? Do you think, "ah, shit, that stupid kid, he needs to know that he was wrong, I should"--

 		FATHER
 	I can't just pat him on the back if he has broken the *law*! It's my **job** to--

		FRIEND
	It's your *job* to scare the shit out of your own son?

The father looks uncomfortable.

 		FATHER
 	Look where we are! I'm outside a Police Office! People who haven't done anything wrong don't come here!

		FRIEND
	Look, the only thing your son needs right now is to feel safe. He's been through more shit today than anyone I've ever seen, but it's getting to him, I can tell.

 		FATHER
 	You think you know *my* son better than I do?

		FRIEND
	Yes. I do. I can tell the difference between his usual level of crazy and the real deal.

 		FATHER
 	Nonsense. I raised that boy.


		FRIEND
	Deny whatever you want.

 		FATHER
 	I certainly will! Especially if I find out he's turned into some sort of criminal!

		FRIEND
	He was my friend.

 		FATHER
 	Has he killed someone? Was he doing drugs? What did my son do?

		FRIEND
	Oh, and now you're interested in what happens to him?

 		FATHER
 	He's my son! of course I--

		FRIEND
	He was my friend.

The wind stops blowing, and the FRIEND is out of cigarettes.

		FRIEND
	Look, your son didn't do anything... He was released an hour ago.

 		FATHER
 	What! And you didn't tell me?

		FRIEND
	I wanted to make sure you didn't screw him up. He's a good kid.

 		FATHER
 	You think I don't know that?

		FRIEND
	I wanted to make sure, for his sake.

 		FATHER
 	So that's why you're still out here in the cold.

		FRIEND
	No. I'm not going to jail tonight, but I feel guilty.

 		FATHER
 	Guilty about what?

		FRIEND
	Nothing, goddamn it. Just, forgive him, when you see him. Forgive him right there and then. He might have been the one in the jail cell, but it isn't all his fault. I gotta go, I'm out of cigarettes.

The FATHER goes to find his son, and his son's FRIEND wanders off, down a dark street.
