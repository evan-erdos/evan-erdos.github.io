Komodo dragons do not look like they belong on this planet anymore. In [the sorts of games I play][spiderweb], there are giant lizards that, among other things, claw, bite, and spit fire. These lizards are not fantasy (aside: [rodents of unusual size][rous] _do_ exist, but I wouldn't look at a capybara and think, "Oh god, it's coming after me!"). They're awe-inspiring, and also bloodlusting deathmachines. I sculpted this one in [ZBrush][zbrush], both because of how interesting their corporeal form is, and also because I can then animate and use the model in a game, because having murderous monitor lizards attack my users is a priority of mine.


“The resistivity shows it’s an insulator; photoemission shows it’s a good insulator; optical absorption shows it’s a good insulator; neutron scattering shows it’s an insulator,” said Lu Li, a condensed matter physicist at the University of Michigan whose experimental group also studies SmB6.

But this is no garden-variety insulator. Not only does its insulating behavior arise from strong correlations between its electrons, but in the past five years, mounting evidence has suggested that it is a “topological insulator” at low temperatures, a material that resists the flow of electricity through its three-dimensional bulk, while conducting electricity along its two-dimensional surfaces. Topological insulators have become one of the hottest topics in condensed matter physics since their 2007 discovery because of their potential use in quantum computers and other novel devices. And yet, SmB6 does not neatly fit that category either.
