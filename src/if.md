I've written a few text adventures. I primarily use [TADS 3][], but started with [Inform 7][], which there was nothing wrong with, but it lacked a sort of rigor that I'd personally want to have anytime I'm programming. If you wanted to get into this sort of thing, [Twine][] might be a good place to start.

**Update:** I have learned a useful piece of information about publishing [TADS 3][] games online from [Emily Boegheim][], namely that you can use [gs.tads.io][] to run a TADS interpreter on any file hosted online. This means, if you give it a \*.t3 file, it should run, no strings attached! So, you *could* play my text adventures online at the [Interactive Fiction Database][], or, you can just click the posts below to be taken to the cool-kids way of hosting and playing text-adventures.

Welcome to the future.
