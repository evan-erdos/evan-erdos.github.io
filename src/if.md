I've written a few text adventures.
I primarily use [TADS 3][], but started with [Inform 7][].
If you wanted to get into this sort of thing,
[Twine][] might be a good place to start.

You can play my text adventures (or anyone else's) online.
Check out the [Interactive Fiction Database][],
or host your own files, and use [gs.tads.io] to play them.
