Under Construction!!!1!
-----------------------

This page isn't done yet. In the future, there might just be some embedded [Unity3D][] projects you can play without worrying about small things like what kind of computer you have or how much space said computer has or if you even like what I do enough to use the aforementioned space on the aforementioned computer to store the aforementioned projects.

For now, there's just some text, and some adventures (also, some text adventures).

See if you can beat the [Toledo Nanochess][] bot! I'm in the process of turning that javascript into `*.coffee`, because I want to learn how it works: it's mathematically astounding that 2kB can create a chess bot that's so hard to beat, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it.
