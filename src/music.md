Here's some really bad recordings. The microphone isn't high-quality, my playing isn't high-quality, the piano is a bit wobbly, I waver quite a bit: the whole affair is a mess, but here it is. I like David Bowie, Paul McCartney (and those other guys who followed him around for awhile in the 60s), Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, and the Velvet Underground. I like to pretend to be Mick Jagger, but being seated at a piano makes that difficult. Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys also constitute a large part of my repertoire. These are extremely raw, perfectly uncut recordings of my better sessions from my [SoundCloud][soundcloud] page.

Full Repertoire
---------------

Below are nicely formatted tables of all the songs I play regularly. The Band is at the top of the list, and the song in the second column is my favorite one to perform. Those are subject to change.

A solid 80% of the links here won't work until I upload a recording of myself performing the song in question. If you get a 404, please refer to this sentence for troubleshooting.
