Hi. Up there's me, ~~pretending to be Paul McCartney walking across the famous Abbey Road.~~ next to a sign that may or may not have been put up because of me. When I'm not disrupting ~~British traffic~~ research, I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University. I like 3D modeling, game development, David Bowie, things made of titanium, playing instruments with strings on them, programming in C, architecture, snowboarding & windsurfing, text adventures, singing the harmony parts in rock ballads, pen-and-ink drawings, graphic design, digital sculpture, and rocket science. I'm most adept with 3D modeling, and I don't actually know how to do rocket science.

Elsewhere on this site, you can find some of the cool things I've done. There's 3D renderings, some poorly-recorded clips of me playing music, and open-source repositories for all my game development projects, which means you can steal all my work and become rich and famous. There's a blog, too! It will display recent projects and posts / tutorials.
