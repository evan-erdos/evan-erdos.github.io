I do the lion's share of my 3D modeling in either AutoCAD or ZBrush. They're on opposite ends of a spectrum, and I find that they complement each other very nicely in terms of the kinds of geometry they can produce, given their respective functionalities. AutoCAD allows me to type numbers in and calculate involute curves on gears and whatnot with AutoLISP, and that leads to very rigid, very precise geometry. ZBrush is exactly the opposite: there's no measuring involved, and most of the workflow consists of pushing thousands of polygons around like clay to make soft, organic models.

## Architecture ##

#### [Counterpoint][counterpoint] ####
It's large, industrial, and has a totally slick [rocket][vulcain] housed in the center.

#### 635 Lindsay Road ####
A passion-project for my grandfather, who built this house with his bare hands (there were rumors of saws and powertools, but we just let the legend *live*).

#### Unit 9 Offices ####
The aforementioned grandfather had me (me!) design the floor plans for some office space, which have since been approved and built from!

#### Amelia Earhart ####
Very early work. She now runs around in [*Counterpoint*][counterpoint] and might be **get lamp**-ing at this very moment.

#### P'fhor ####
Creepy alien, modeled after the sort you'd find aboard the [*Marathon*][marathon].

## Other ##


#### Rocket Engine ####
Can't live with them, can't something something mumble... yeah, that'd be pretty noisy. Anyways, I made a rocket.
