I do the lion's share of my 3D modeling in either AutoCAD or ZBrush. They're on opposite ends of a spectrum, and I find that they complement each other very nicely in terms of the kinds of geometry they can produce, given their respective functionalities. AutoCAD allows me to type numbers in and calculate involute curves on gears and whatnot with AutoLISP, and that leads to very rigid, very precise geometry. ZBrush is exactly the opposite: there's no measuring involved, and most of the workflow consists of pushing thousands of polygons around like clay to make soft, organic models.
