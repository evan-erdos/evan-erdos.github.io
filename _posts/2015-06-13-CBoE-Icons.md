I've made a really epsilon number of commits to this repository, but it's one of my favorite games ever, technically.

One of the first games I played was a rewrite of this game, Blades of Exile. At age 3, I would have been too young to grasp concepts like what all the spells do, basic object permanance, the whole "reading the plot" part, that was right out... but one of the first games I did play, in my life, was Avernum 3, which is little more than a graphics upgrade for Exile 3, the game which preceeded Blades of Exile. Long story short, [Spiderweb Software Games][] were and are my life, and I feel really warm and fuzzy inside when I fix things or make new graphics for the old thing.
