I'm giving a talk!
If you're going to attend (and you want to write your own adventure)
you will need a few things.
The sample project is written in [TADS 3][] and is on [GitHub][].

To start writing text adventures, you'll need to:

- install TADS 3 with your favourite package manager
- no package manager, huh? Ok, get it from the [TADS][] site
- if you don't even know what a package manager is:
    - you're probably an OS X user
    - and you should use the installer:
        - [OS X Installer][] *(3.7Mb download)*
- if you don't have a bash emulator on your DOS machine:
    - you aught to think about why you're even using Windows
    - now that you're done thinking, consider getting Workbench:
        - [Workbench][] *(18Mb download)*

Now, you're ready for my talk!
You're also ready to begin writing your own text adventure!
