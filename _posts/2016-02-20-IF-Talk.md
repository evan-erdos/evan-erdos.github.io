I'm giving a talk!
If you want to follow along during the talk, you'll need a few things.

To start writing text adventures, you'll need to:

- install [TADS 3][] with your favourite package manager
- no package manager, huh? Ok, get it from the [TADS][] site
- if you don't even know what a package manager is:
    - you're probably an OS X user
    - and you should use the installer:
        - [OS X Installer][] *(3.7MB download)*
- if you don't have a bash emulator on your DOS machine:
    - you aught to think about why you're even using Windows
    - now that you're done thinking, consider getting Workbench:
        - [Workbench][] *(18MB download)*

Now, you're ready for my talk!
You're ready to begin writing your own text adventure!

Well, almost.

The sample project is on [GitHub][], but can also be downloaded here:

- [IF-Template][] *(v1.0.0, 37kB)*

Now you're ready!
