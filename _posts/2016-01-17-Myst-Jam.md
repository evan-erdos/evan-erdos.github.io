I participated in a Game Jam!

I made at least 1/4 of a thing!

Don't download it, it's awful!

It's super hacky, trust me, just look at the pretty pictures!

It was so much fun, even though my final product was a completely incoherent mess, I had fun throwing it together.

The final build (well, I shouldn't call it a *build*, because it wouldn't build, it would just crash) seemed to have trouble with the movie textures I used for the link pages to the other Ages, so I had to take them out, last minute.
A bunch of other nonsense transpired, too.
