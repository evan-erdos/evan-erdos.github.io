I participated in a Game Jam!
It was so much fun, even though my final product was a mess.

The final build (well, I shouldn't call it a *build*, because it wouldn't build, it would just crash) seemed to have trouble with the movie textures I used for the link pages to the other Ages, so I had to take them out, last minute.

Details about the Jam can be found at the page, and my entry can be found [here][].
