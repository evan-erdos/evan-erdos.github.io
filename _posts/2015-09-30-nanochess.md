See if you can beat the [Toledo Nanochess][] bot! It's 1683 characters. That's it. Pretty neat, huh?

I'm in the process of turning the underlying javascript into `*.coffee`, because I want to learn how it works: it's mathematically astounding that 2kB can create a chess bot that's so hard to beat, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it.

For reference, this is the entire source code.
