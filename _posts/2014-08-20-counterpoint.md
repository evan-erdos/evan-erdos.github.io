I seem to gravitate towards radial architecture when I set out to draft a building. I also seem to cling to words from a bygone era to describe new technology: Draft? Nobody uses drafting tables anymore, it's all CAD!

I would really like to travel back in time and watch people in the 1940s use nothing but pens and rulers to create the P-51 Mustang. [Ivan Sutherland][ivan], one of my heroes (and a CMU alumnus), first ran [Sketchpad][sketch] on an MIT mainframe circa 1959. 8 years later, on November 9th, 1967, the first manned flight of the Saturn V screamed across the sky. This, to me, is tantamount to the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza. I don't quite know how they managed it. Below is an open-air building I modeled in the likeness of NASA test facilities, among other technical monstrosities. There is a large, multi-level hangar in the back, and the rest of the building is wrapped around a central core. I hope to get back to this project, and to endow it with finer details and complicated truss-work and the like. For now, it's little more than a [playground for Amelia][amelia].

### Edit: ###
I did go back to it! There are some finer points to it now, some better details & UV mapping, a new [rocket](/3d/vulcain), and a brand new annex.
