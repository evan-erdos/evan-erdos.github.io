It's large, industrial, and has a totally slick [rocket][] housed in the center.

I seem to gravitate towards radial architecture when I set out to draft a building.
There is a large, multi-level hangar in the back, and the rest of the building is wrapped around a central core.

Here's an earlier video, showing off some of the advanced character animation.

### Edit: ###
There are some finer points to it now, some better details & UV mapping, a new [rocket][], and a brand new annex.
