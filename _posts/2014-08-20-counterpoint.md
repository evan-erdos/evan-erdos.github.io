It's large, industrial, and has a totally slick [rocket][] housed in the center.

I seem to gravitate towards radial architecture when I set out to draft a building.
I also seem to cling to words from a bygone era to describe new technology: Draft? Nobody uses drafting tables anymore, it's all CAD!

I would really like to travel back in time and watch people in the 1940s use nothing but pens and rulers to create the P-51 Mustang. [Ivan Sutherland][], one of my heroes (and a CMU alumnus), first ran [sketchpad][] on an MIT mainframe circa 1959.
8 years later, on November 9th, 1967, the first manned flight of the Saturn V screamed across the sky.
This, to me, is tantamount to the construction of the Great Pyramids of Giza.
I don't quite know how they managed it.
Below is an open-air building I modeled in the likeness of NASA test facilities, among other technical monstrosities.
There is a large, multi-level hangar in the back, and the rest of the building is wrapped around a central core.
I hope to get back to this project, and to endow it with finer details and complicated truss-work and the like.
For now, it's little more than a playground for [Amelia][].

### Edit: ###
I did go back to it!
There are some finer points to it now, some better details & UV mapping, a new [rocket][], and a brand new annex.
