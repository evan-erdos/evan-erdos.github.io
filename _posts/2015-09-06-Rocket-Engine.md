This model is one of my favorites, and as such, I "installed" it as the centerpiece of my favourite building, (which I have monikered *[Counterpoint][]*).

It also isn't finished yet, but given the context of a derelict building, the version which resides in *Counterpoint* will be this one.
Properly drawn up are the engine's bell, the fuel turbopump (but not the oxidizer's) and the fuel heat-coil, which is probably my favorite engineering system ever: After initial takeoff, the liquid hydrogen is pumped in a path around the bell, in a tube which grows in diameter to accomodate the expanding volume of the liquid being heated by the combustion process itself, until it too is sent to the combustion chamber.
I have, perhaps uniquely, and certainly falsely, made this path to end in a torus-like injection system, the heated hydrogen being atomized into the upper space, and the oxide being thoroughly mixed into it around the large array of holes leading into the main combustion chamber.
Would this thing ever fly, with this design?
No, of course not, but it looks neat, doesn't it?
