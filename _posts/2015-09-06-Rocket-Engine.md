Rocket engines inspire me: the nuances and specifics of their operation are excessively fascinating to me, and even if you know literally *epsilon* about rocket science, it's still quite interesting to read about where the fuel goes, how they figured out how to do this, that, and the other thing, etc., and there's also some very interesting history, if you're into that sort of thing.

Their form begins in an extremely no-nonsense fashion, with pipes and chambers spouting and jutting every which way, being only constrained by the fact that they have to sort of fit in a circle so that they can actually be affixed to the rockets they're designed to send into space. This changes as one looks down the engine and towards the bell. The ideal thrust curve for whatever particular altitude range the rocket may have has its own, unique shape. These shapes range from the sorts of grand, elegant curves that one might find on the first stage of a Saturn V, to the petite maneuvering thrusters installed at a ship's extremities, arranged like high-tech, explosive loudspeakers.

This model is one of my favorites, and as such, I "installed" it as the centerpiece of my favourite building, (which I have monikered *[Counterpoint][]*). It also isn't finished yet, but given the context of a derelict building, the version which resides in *Counterpoint* will be this one. Properly drawn up are the engine's bell, the fuel turbopump (but not the oxidizer's) and the fuel heat-coil, which is probably my favorite engineering system ever: After initial takeoff, the liquid hydrogen is pumped in a path around the bell, in a tube which grows in diameter to accomodate the expanding volume of the liquid being heated by the combustion process itself, until it too is sent to the combustion chamber. I have, perhaps uniquely, and certainly falsely, made this path to end in a torus-like injection system, the heated hydrogen being atomized into the upper space, and the oxide being thoroughly mixed into it around the large array of holes leading into the main combustion chamber. Would this thing ever fly, with this design? No, of course not, but it looks neat, doesn't it?
