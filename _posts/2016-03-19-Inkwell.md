Introducing Inkwell,
a little script that embeds screenplays into your websites.

While it's still under development,
it works well enough to be used here:

{% include begin-inkwell.html %}
INT. BESCOTT.ORG/INKWELL, DAY

Out of the blue, someone begins to read a webpage.

READER
Wow, I'm reading!

AUDIENCE
Yeah, look at you go!


{% include end-inkwell.html %}
