I wrote a syntax highlighter for [Sublime Text][].

It works for anything that could be mistaken for C, and borders on being gaudy and not tasteful.
Class names and accessors have gradients, parentheses both change colors as they nest, and are also somewhat context-sensitive (the parentheses for an if statement show up blue, function calls are tan, and others remain white).
It's on my [GitHub][] page.
