title: Amelia Earhart

Amelia Earhart was pretty cool. I decided to 3D model her for a high-school project that never came to fruition (do they ever?). Basically, the user would have played as Amelia Earhart, recently crash-landed on a strange island. Gee, that would have been an interesting premise, huh?

She lives on, as she's the first character I rigged to work in my Unity projects. It's all really one Unity project, I just keep adding features and tech to different parts of my codebase / artbase something something, here's the result.
