Komodo dragons do not look like they belong on this planet anymore. I sculpted this one in [ZBrush][zbrush], both because of how interesting their corporeal form is, and also because I can then animate and use the model in a game.

Having murderous monitor lizards attack my users is a priority of mine. In [the sorts of games I play][spiderweb], there are giant lizards that, among other things, claw, bite, and spit fire. These lizards are not fantasy (aside: [rodents of unusual size][rous] _do_ exist, but I wouldn't look at a capybara and think, "Oh god, it's coming after me!"). They're awe-inspiring, and also bloodlusting deathmachines. Watch him spin!
