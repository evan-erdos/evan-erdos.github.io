Komodo dragons will screw you up.


Komodo dragons do not look like they belong on this planet anymore.
I sculpted this one in [ZBrush][], both because of how interesting their corporeal form is, and also because I can then animate and use the model in a game.

Having murderous monitor lizards attack my users is a priority of mine.
In [the sorts of games I play][spiderweb], there are giant lizards that, among other things, claw, bite, and spit fire.
These lizards are not fantasy (aside: [rodents of unusual size][rous] _do_ exist, but I wouldn't look at a capybara and think, "Oh god, it's coming after me!").
They're awe-inspiring, and also bloodlusting deathmachines.
Watch him spin!
