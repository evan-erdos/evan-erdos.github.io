Komodo dragons will screw you up.


Having murderous monitor lizards attack folks in my games is a priority.
In [the sorts of games I play][spiderweb], there are giant lizards which,
among other things, claw, bite, and spit fire.
These lizards are not fantasy: they're very real, bloodlusting deathmachines.
Watch him spin!
