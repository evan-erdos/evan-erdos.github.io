If I were more clever, there'd be a WebGL demo of the project on this page.

The 1950s were weird.
My grandfather built his [house][] in a neighborhood full of cookie-cutter houses, and I made this small demo to try to address what duplication means in this new, digital context.
Every house can be the house he dreamed up and built.

Something I'd like to continue to develop is the [Level of Detail][] rendering, specifically, using this fairly-ubiquitous process for something entirely different than for what it was intended (in this case, rendering different seasons on the basis of how far things are from the player *physically*).
This version doesn't differentiate the seasons very well, but with a cleaner implementation of some things, I'd be able to achieve more of what I wanted to (snow, perhaps image effects for warm / bloomy summers, etc).
