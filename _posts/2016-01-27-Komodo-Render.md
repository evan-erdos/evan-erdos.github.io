I'm kicking myself for not learning Maya a long, long time ago.
It's just so much fun.

This lizard is actually a rework of a prior model I made of a [Komodo Dragon][komodo].

I slid so many sliders to get the sand to even come close to looking right.
In the end, it just ended up looking more like a smoothie in a blender or something.

The sculpt deformers were broken when I scaled up all the frames.
I've since realized that the frames can be snapped to the grid en-masse.

I do wonder if I could export this sort of animation statically.
It seems like caching is the answer to that.
