{"name":"Ben Scott","tagline":"A person with assorted talents","body":"\r\n### About Me\r\nHi. I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon, and a bunch of other things. I like 3D modeling, game development, David Bowie, things made of titanium, architecture, playing instruments with strings on them, programming in C, snowboarding & windsurfing (sports where the goal is to stay _out_ of water, as opposed to swimming), text adventures, the harmony parts in rock ballads, pen-and-ink drawings, graphic design, digital sculpture (which is basically the first one, but squishier), and rocket science. I'm most adept with 3D modeling, and I don't actually know how to do rocket science. Below are some of the things that I do. \r\n\r\n## Game Development\r\nThese projects are my proudest works. They exist at the _confluence_ of all these other media (restrain from throwing things across rooms because I used that word), and the sum is far greater than the parts. While this whole process is considered \"Game Development\", and while I do make games with it, I find that there's more potential in this medium. I also think there's a trivial, and moreover justified stigma about \"games\", which evokes a notion of wasting time on your coffee break or playing a colorful puzzle thing on your iPhone on the bus to accumulate \"points\". I want to distance myself from that. Hopefully, my work will do that for me.\r\n\r\n[Amelia Earhart in a Large Building](youtube.com/watchsomething)\r\n[Term Project Demo](unity.com/otherthing)\r\n[Pathways](youtube.com/w2k3)\r\n[EP Lab Video](youtube.com/EP_thing)\r\n\r\n# Nature:\r\n- [That one with the Cliffs](asdf.org)\r\n- [That one with the Rocks](asldkfj.com)\r\n- [That one with the Glowing Rocks](aslkdjf.com)\r\n\r\n## 3D Modeling \r\nI do the lion's share of my 3D modeling in either AutoCAD or ZBrush (I have an A-to-Z understanding of both of them, really). They're on opposite ends of a spectrum, and I find that they complement each other very nicely, in terms of the kinds of geometry they let me make. AutoCAD lets me type numbers in and calculate involute curves on gears and whatnot with AutoLISP, and that leads to very rigid, very precise geometry. ZBrush is exactly the opposite. There's no measuring involved, and most of the workflow consists of pushing thousands of polygons around to make more organic models.\r\n\r\n# Architecture:\r\n- [TOKAMAK]\r\n- [Counterpoint]\r\n- [645 Lindsay Road]\r\n- [Unit 8 Offices]\r\n- [Charon]\r\n\r\n# Life:\r\n- [Komodo Dragon]\r\n- [Amelia Earhart]\r\n- [P'fhor]\r\n\r\n# Other:\r\n- [Rocket]\r\n- [Chess Set]\r\n\r\n## Recordings\r\nI've got a nasty habit of getting distracted from whatever I am supposed to be doing, and then wandering off to do something else. \"Something Else (tm)\" typically involves one of the categories on this page, and this is no exception. Sometimes, I'll gravitate towards the nearest piano like some sort of musical homing pigeon, and I'll just start accosting it. I'll sit down, and start screaming at it until people ask me to leave. Sometimes my singing has nuance and tenderness, but it more often resembles lambasting. I like David Bowie, Paul McCartney (and those other guys who followed him around for awhile in the 60s), Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, and the Velvet Underground. I like to pretend to be Mick Jagger, which the confining nature of pianos doesn't always allow for, but I make do. Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys also constitute a large part of my repertoire. Here are some extremely raw, perfectly uncut recordings of my better sessions. I typically play 3-5 hours at a time (due more to inattention and a lack of time sense rather than any actual dedication to the art), and there's a lot of mistakes and downtime between song selection, but I've isolated the best parts in individual files. \r\n\r\n# Beach Boys:\r\n- [Caroline, No]\r\n- [God Only Knows]\r\n- [Here Today]\r\n- [I'm Waiting For the Day]\r\n- [Surfer Girl]\r\n- [Warmth of the Sun]\r\n- [Wouldn't it be Nice?]\r\n\r\n# Beatles:\r\n- [All I've Got to Do]\r\n- [All My Loving]\r\n- [Don't Let Me Down]\r\n- [For No One]\r\n- [Hey Jude]\r\n- [I Should Have Known Better]\r\n- [I Will]\r\n- [I'm In Love]\r\n- [In My Life]\r\n- [It's Only Love]\r\n- [Lady Madonna]\r\n- [Lovely Rita]\r\n- [Michelle]\r\n- [Misery]\r\n- [Not a Second Time]\r\n- [Oh Darling]\r\n- [Real Love]\r\n- [She's Leaving Home]\r\n- [Something]\r\n- [The Fool on the Hill]\r\n- [This Boy]\r\n- [Two of Us]\r\n- [Yes It Is]\r\n- [Yesterday]\r\n\r\n# Billy Joel:\r\n- [And So it Goes]\r\n- [Lullaby]\r\n\r\n# Bob Dylan:\r\n- [Abandoned Love]\r\n- [Don't Think Twice, It's All Right]\r\n- [Girl From the North Country]\r\n- [Hurricane]\r\n- [If You See Her, Say Hello]\r\n- [It Ain't Me, Babe]\r\n- [Like a Rolling Stone]\r\n- [My Back Pages]\r\n- [Queen Jane, Approximately]\r\n- [Simple Twist of Fate]\r\n- [Tangled Up in Blue]\r\n- [You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go]\r\n\r\n# David Bowie:\r\n- [Changes]\r\n- [Fill Your Heart]\r\n- [Lady Stardust]\r\n- [Letters To Hermione]\r\n- [Life On Mars?]\r\n- [Oh, You Pretty Things]\r\n- [Starman]\r\n- [Watch That Man]\r\n\r\n# Elton John:\r\n- [Daniel]\r\n- [Rocket Man]\r\n- [Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting]\r\n- [Tiny Dancer]\r\n- [Your Song]\r\n\r\n# Kanye West? :\r\n- [Only One]\r\n- On Sight (not really)\r\n\r\n# Otis Redding:\r\n- Try a Little Tenderness\r\n\r\n# Paul McCartney:\r\n- [Maybe I'm Amazed]\r\n- [New]\r\n- [Tomorrow]\r\n\r\n# Rolling Stones: \r\n- [Angie]\r\n- [Beast of Burden]\r\n- [Dead Flowers]\r\n- [Following the River / Let it Loose]\r\n\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"128\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/208348981&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n- [Happy]\r\n- [Heartbreaker]\r\n- [Lady Jane]\r\n- [Let's Spend the Night Together]\r\n- [Loving Cup]\r\n- [Miss You]\r\n- [Rip This Joint]\r\n- [Rocks Off]\r\n- [Ruby Tuesday]\r\n- [So Divine]\r\n- [Time is On My Side]\r\n\r\n# Stevie Wonder:\r\n- [Don't You Worry 'bout a Thing]\r\n- [For Once in My Life]\r\n- [Isn't She Lovely?]\r\n- [Knocks Me Off My Feet]\r\n- [Living for the City]\r\n- [My Cherie Amour]\r\n- [Signed, Sealed, Delivered]\r\n- [Sir Duke]\r\n- [Summer Soft]\r\n\r\n# Velvet Underground:\r\n- [Femme Fatale]\r\n- [I Found A Reason]\r\n- [I'll Be Your Mirror]\r\n- [Stephanie Says]\r\n- [Sunday Morning]\r\n- [There She Goes]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Writing\r\nI wrote a text adventure. It's written in TADS3, which is basically C for interactive fiction, and it's all on GitHub, if you want to steal my prose and become rich and famous. You can play it online at the [Interactive Fiction Database.]\r\n\r\n[vividity link]\r\n\r\n## Text Highlighting\r\nI have a really cool syntax highlighter that I wrote for Sublime Text. It works for anything that could be mistaken for C, and borders on being gaudy and not tasteful. Class names and accessors have gradients, parentheses both change colors as they nest, and are also somewhat context-sensitive, so the parentheses for an if statement show up blue, while others remain white. It's on my GitHub page.\r\n\r\n[varicolor]\r\n\r\n## Blag\r\nTODO: Start writing a blog\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
